##Introduction
Welcome to my first project as a junior data analyst for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. After completing 8 courses in this professional track and acquiring a wealth of knowledge and skills, I am eager to apply what I have learned to a real-world challenge. This case study marks the final step in completing the professional certificate, allowing me to showcase my ability to analyse and extract insights from complex data. In this project, I will be working with a large dataset using Excel, SQL, BigQuery, and R language to demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis. I will also be visualizing my findings using Tableau.
